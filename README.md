Remote Sensing
==============

This was originally my geos-422 class repository.  The [Wiki][https://github.com/dayne/remote-sensing/wiki] turned out to be most useful result of the respoitory and is now primary focus. Renamed the project to 'remote-sensing' to act as a catch all spot for thoughts about and random script blobs.
